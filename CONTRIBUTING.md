# Contributing to DriftKeys

Thanks for wanting to help improve DriftKeys! Here's how you can get started quickly and make the most of your contributions.

## Setting up a Local Development Environment

To contribute code, you need a way to test your changes live. Here's a simple setup:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name

2. **Open the project folder in a code editor like VSCode.**

3. **Run a local server:**

   DriftKeys is a static HTML+JS project. To avoid issues with browser restrictions (like CORS), run a local server.

   You can use any of these simple options:

   * **VSCode Live Server extension:**
     Just right-click `Racing Game.html` and click "Open with Live Server".

   * **Python 3 server:**

     ```bash
     python3 -m http.server 8000
     ```

     Then open `http://localhost:8000/Racing%20Game.html` in your browser.

4. **Make changes and test:**

   Edit the `Racing Game.html` file and refresh your browser to see updates.

## Debugging and Testing Tips

* Open Developer Tools in your browser (F12 or right-click â†’ Inspect) and check the Console tab for errors or logs.
* Use `console.log()` in your JavaScript code to track values or flow.
* Try small changes and test often to catch issues early.
